This is a hands-on introduction to FinTech and Blockchains for future data scientists. The course has the following objectives:
 * teach blockchain and its technological foundations in a hands-on, code-driven approach
 * explore the disruptive potential of digital transformation for financial intermediation
 * discuss machine learning strategies that future data scientists should know for FinTech lending and insurance underwriting.
 * enable students to run their first project of their own and explore creatively.
 * develop the necessary coding skills on the side.

The course is taught as a mix of lectures and lab sessions which teach applied, more technical skills.
